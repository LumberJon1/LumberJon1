# Hello, There!

## A Little About Me
My name is Jonathan and I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer with a particular interest in front-end development and a commitment to lifelong learning.
I have a background in the world of personal finance, but alongside my studies in finance and economics I developed (no pun intended) an early interest
in programming when I discovered Java and Python in college.  Since then I have continued to learn both on my own and through a Web Development bootcamp
course through the University of Arizona.  I can't wait to see where my future endeavors take my learning from here!
