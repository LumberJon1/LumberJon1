# Hello, There!

## A Little About Me
My name is Jonathan and I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer with a particular interest in front-end development and a commitment to lifelong learning.
I have a background in the world of personal finance, but alongside my studies in finance and economics I developed (no pun intended) an early interest
in programming when I discovered Java and Python in college.  Since then I have continued to learn both on my own and through a Web Development bootcamp
course at the University of Arizona.

I've worked on many personal projects in Python and pandas analyzing data from APIs and CSV files, created my own 
REST APIs in Javascript and Java that feed front ends built in React, and made pet projects to help me as I continue to learn Japanese and Spanish in my
scarce free time.  My experience touching many aspects of software and web development - using many languages and frameworks - continues to be a fun and
enlightening process.  I can't wait to see where my future endeavors take my learning and work from here!
